# Microsoft Azure Words of the Day

Thanks for your interest in our work.

We are helping beginners to find the definitions of topics related to Azure, and the cloud in general. **Words of the Day** is a Glossary, an Encyclopedia, a Wikipedia of technical words, expressions, and abbreviations. It helps visitors getting started with a new cloud-related topic by making it easy to understand the vocabulary. It also helps Microsoft documentation writers by providing a unique repository of topics that they can link to. 

Each word, expression or abbreviation is illustrated by a short video explaining the concept. Items are cross-referenced, a little like Wikipedia does. In addition, we also list links to documentation and Microsoft Learn.
