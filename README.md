# Microsoft Glossary

Thanks for your interest in our work.

We are helping people (beginners and experts) to find the definitions of terms related to Azure, and the cloud in general. The **Microsoft Glossary** is a Dictionary, an Encyclopedia, a Wikipedia of technical words, expressions, and abbreviations. It helps visitors getting started with a new Microsoft-related topic by making it easy to understand the vocabulary. It also helps Microsoft documentation writers by providing a unique repository of terms that they can link to.

Each word, expression or abbreviation is illustrated by a short video explaining the concept. Items are cross-referenced, a little like Wikipedia does. In addition, we also list links to documentation and Microsoft Learn.
