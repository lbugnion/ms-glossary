Today's word of the day is: Serverless

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,101
Hello and welcome to Microsoft
Azure Words of the Day

3
00:00:08,126 --> 00:00:11,253
this is the show that teaches
you the Azure vocabulary!

4
00:00:12,034 --> 00:00:14,976
Serverless means that your
code runs on a server,

5
00:00:15,001 --> 00:00:17,937
but you don't have to worry about it.
It is abstracted.

6
00:00:17,962 --> 00:00:22,930
As a developer, you can concentrate on writing
the code, testing it and deploying it.

7
00:00:22,954 --> 00:00:24,954
Several features are automated:

8
00:00:24,978 --> 00:00:30,044
Starting the application, listening to
events to start the execution of the code,

9
00:00:30,069 --> 00:00:33,624
 scaling up and down
when the demand fluctuates, etc.

10
00:00:33,648 --> 00:00:38,898
Typically serverless solutions are paid by
the execution time, in a consumption model.

11
00:00:38,922 --> 00:00:43,735
Most cloud providers offer free tiers with
which you can run a serverless application

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,545
for a certain amount of time, or a
certain amount of executions, for free.

13
00:00:48,814 --> 00:00:51,315
On Microsoft Azure,
there are quite a few solutions

14
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,914
that you can use to run your
code in a serverless manner,

15
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:59,539
for example Azure Functions, Logic
Apps, SignalR as a service, etc etc

16
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:02,878
Here is one example of
serverless application on Azure:

17
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:07,731
In an Azure Function, you start the execution
of your code by observing some triggers.

18
00:01:07,837 --> 00:01:09,878
There are a number of trigger
types, for example

19
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:13,475
HTTP triggers to respond
to an HTTP request;

20
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,561
timer trigger to execute
code on a schedule;

21
00:01:16,586 --> 00:01:20,850
event grid triggers to answer to events
happening in another Azure service;

22
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:25,192
Cosmos DB trigger to execute code
when something changes in a database;

23
00:01:25,217 --> 00:01:26,290
and many more.

24
00:01:26,315 --> 00:01:28,794
Or another example of
serverless application:

25
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:32,338
A Logic App also starts its
execution when an event happens.

26
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,943
There are many
sources of events,

27
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:37,399
for example when you receive
an email in Outlook or Gmail,

28
00:01:37,424 --> 00:01:42,377
when a document is modified in Office
365, and many many many more.

29
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:44,153
One really nice
feature of serverless

30
00:01:44,178 --> 00:01:47,624
is that your application will
automatically scale up and down.

31
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:50,254
Here we see how an Azure
Function application is

32
00:01:50,279 --> 00:01:53,104
automatically scaling
up to additional servers

33
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:56,097
This way you are covered,
if a lot of people like your product,

34
00:01:56,122 --> 00:01:59,060
we will provide additional
servers to cover the demand.

35
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:02,062
And since you only pay for
what you actually consume,

36
00:02:02,087 --> 00:02:05,042
serverless solutions end up
being quite cost effective.

37
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,400
There are more serverless
solutions on Azure,

38
00:02:07,425 --> 00:02:10,733
so don't forget to check the links
here in order to know more about that.

39
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:14,079
Thank you so much for watching
Microsoft Azure Words of the Day.
