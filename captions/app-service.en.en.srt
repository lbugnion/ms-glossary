Today's words of the day are: App Service

2
00:00:05,808 --> 00:00:08,626
Hello and welcome to
Microsoft Azure Words of the Day

3
00:00:08,651 --> 00:00:11,585
this is the show that teaches
you the Azure vocabulary!

4
00:00:12,394 --> 00:00:16,325
An App Service is a web server
running as a service in Microsoft Azure.

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,056
So you can run HTTP based applications

6
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:23,580
for example a mobile backend,
a web API, a website etc.

7
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:26,381
The really cool thing is that
you can choose between Windows

8
00:00:26,452 --> 00:00:29,683
and Linux as your operating
system, so you have a choice.

9
00:00:29,762 --> 00:00:33,484
And you can deploy your code,
either in a Docker based container

10
00:00:33,532 --> 00:00:35,444
or directly from Github,

11
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:39,351
from other repositories or from a
continuous deployment solution.

12
00:00:39,704 --> 00:00:42,892
Around App Services,
you can also configure a lot of features

13
00:00:42,923 --> 00:00:45,542
for example different
deployment solutions,

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,867
Authorization and
Authentication,

15
00:00:47,998 --> 00:00:51,974
Identity, Backups,
Custom domains,

16
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,333
TLS and SSL to enable
HTTPS,

17
00:00:55,571 --> 00:00:58,387
you can also automatically
scale up and scale down

18
00:00:58,476 --> 00:01:01,719
for example to respond to a
lot of demand very fast.

19
00:01:01,955 --> 00:01:03,605
Let's check the application

20
00:01:03,635 --> 00:01:06,542
now this here is an
ASP.NET Core application

21
00:01:06,573 --> 00:01:10,322
running a React.JS front end,
but App Services also support

22
00:01:10,347 --> 00:01:16,486
classic .NET, Java,
Node.js, Ruby, Python, PHP,

23
00:01:16,511 --> 00:01:18,702
so you have a choice
for your framework.

24
00:01:18,902 --> 00:01:22,344
In the Azure portal you can check
the health of your app service,

25
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:27,018
and there is also Application Insights
which is a very rich monitoring solution.

26
00:01:27,173 --> 00:01:31,065
If I scroll down further we can
see more monitoring solutions,

27
00:01:31,151 --> 00:01:33,747
for example the Log Stream
which allows me to see

28
00:01:33,772 --> 00:01:36,864
what is happening in my
application in real time

29
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:40,062
That's quite handy to avoid
having to download the logs.

30
00:01:40,174 --> 00:01:42,958
App Services have a lot of
additional functionalities,

31
00:01:42,983 --> 00:01:45,911
so make sure to check the links
here to know more about that

32
00:01:46,136 --> 00:01:49,390
Thank you so much for watching
Microsoft Azure Words of the Day

00:01:49,415 --> 00:01:52,279
