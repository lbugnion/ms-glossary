# Microsoft Glossary Pilot Phase

![We need you](./images/WeNeedYou.jpg)

Thanks for your interest in helping [the Microsoft Glossary](http://gslb.ch/gloss) to grow. This is a new Docs section dedicated to definitions of Microsoft (or general tech) related terms. The hardest part when learning a technology is to understand the "dialect" and all the terms. The Microsoft Glossary is helping with this issue. It's also a great opportunity for everyone at Microsoft to have a single repository of words, expressions and abbreviations, easy to maintain and to which all content writers can refer.

**At the moment, we are looking for content authors who can help grow the number of topics. Here are some topics that we need help for:**

- .NET / .NET Core
- Application Insights
- ARM
- ARM Template
- Bash
- Blazor
- CDN
- CLI
- Codespace
- Compliance
- Connector
- CORS
- Device twin
- DevOps
- DNS
- Docker Hub
- IOT
- K8s
- Key Vault
- Kusto
- Metrics
- MySQL
- NodeJS
- NoSQL
- PostgreSQL
- PowerBI
- PowerShell
- REST
- Root Case Analyses RCA
- Round robin
- Sharding
- SLA
- SNI
- SQL
- SSO
- TTL Time To Live (for custom domains)

Thank you!

## Video pitch and transcript

What is, for you, the hardest part of getting into a new technology? For me, it’s learning the language, the vocabulary, the abbreviations…

In fact it's hard for everyone, and it also gives a feeling of not being included. While we can limit the number of acronyms, we still need to teach the meaning of the domain specific words that we use.

Searching on the web produces mediocre results. Here for example AAD, at Microsoft, means Azure Active Directory, but for the public it can have a very different meaning.
Even in our own docs, searching for AAD delivers relevant pages but they are not answering the simple question: Can you tell me in 2 minutes what AAD actually is.

This is where the Microsoft Glossary helps to solve the problem. This page is a new area of docs.Microsoft.com, a dictionary of topics related to Microsoft technologies. Topics in the Microsoft Glossary don't have to be directly related to Microsoft, they just need to be relevant in the context of our tech.
Here you can see the private preview of the Glossary, accessible to all Microsoft employees.

Many of the topics can be illustrated by short videos. Here is an example. We want the videos to be informative, entertaining and to drive traffic to the Glossary, and from there to Microsoft properties. Here for example we have "Azure Words of the Day", a series of Azure related topics in a format that can be used on social media, to promote the Glossary. Each video has a maximum of 2 minutes to be suitable for Twitter. Note that similar videos can also be produced for Microsoft 365, Windows or any Microsoft tech.

Each topic answers a number of keywords. For example here when we search for Web Server, we are redirected to the App Service topic. This is similar to what Wikipedia does, a clear inspiration for the Glossary.

Further down, we find related links leading the reader to Docs.Microsoft.com as well as to Microsoft Learn. Of course the links can be tracked for usage, bringing fame and fortune to the topic's author.

We also see the transcript of the video. This allows people with hearing impairment to take advantage of the content. It also improves the searchability of the Glossary. Additionally, we find links in the text cross referencing other topics in the Glossary. This is again inspired by Wikipedia. Each link brings the user to a new topic, and helps with their learning experience.

The Glossary is integrated in the Docs ecosystem. It means that we use markdown, a simple text format, for all the authoring work. Docs content creators and other authors in general are familiar with the markdown format and with GitHub. We also use the Docs build system.
Docs are automatically translated and we can take advantage of this. However we will also need a system to provide pages in different languages manually so we can check the quality of the translation.
The search engine optimization of Docs will also apply to the Glossary, we are working on concepts to make it even better.
And finally, like already mentioned, we link back to other Microsoft content.

Everyone at Microsoft can profit from the work we are doing. For example, content authors don't need to define every term over and over again. Instead they can easily link back to the relevant topic in the Glossary. We can even foresee a user-friendly integration, for example with a popup like illustrated here.

Are you interested in this ambitious project? We need you. We need to build a basis of topics so that we can present this project to our executives and gain official approval. If you want to help us, go to this URL or send us an email for more information. Thank you for your attention!!
