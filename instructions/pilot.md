# Microsoft Glossary Pilot Phase

Thank you for your interest in helping us! If you have not done so already, [please check this video](TODO)

## How can I help?

We need  to build a base of terms so that we can present this project to our executives and gain approval to expand it and go public. Below you will find the list of terms that we are concentrating on.

If you want to help, [go to the following address](https://aka.ms/define/new). Fill the form, and you will get instructions on how to create the new Glossary page.

You can also get more information on the editing experience in our [Getting started pages](./getting-started.md).

Thanks so much for your helps, [don't hesitate to contact us for more information](mailto:msglossary@microsoft.com)!!
