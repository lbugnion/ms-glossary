## Submitting the pull request

Once you are done editing the document, you should submit it for review. This is done with a process that GitHub calls `Pull request`.

> **VERY IMPORTANT** Make sure that all your changes are `committed to Cloud` before you submit the pull request.

1. Navigate to `https://github.com/lbugnion/ms-glossary/tree/your-term-name` where `your-term-name` is the file name you used to log into the Synopsis client.

> After you Commit to the Cloud in the Synopsis Client, the link will be shown to you.
