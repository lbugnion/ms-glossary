# Creating content for the Glossary: Getting started

Thank you so much for contributing to the Glossary. With your help, we can grow and maintain the content to create a reference repository of words, expressions and abbreviations.

## Definitions

### Term

A `Term` is a Glossary entry. A Term can be a simple word (for example `serverless`), an expression or group of words (for example `app service`) or an abbreviation (for example `tls/ssl`). It can be a product name (for example `Azure Active Directory`) or a technological expression related to Microsoft products and services (for example `web server`).

### Page

A Term translates to a `Page` in the Glossary. For example the Term `app service` is explained [in this page](https://aka.ms/define/app-service).

### Keyword

A `Keyword` is a Term that is defined in the Glossary but **doesn't have its own page**. In the Glossary, when a Keyword is clicked, we redirect the reader to the related Page. For example [Encryption](https://aka.ms/define/encryption) is a Keyword which redirects to the Page titled `TLS/SSL`.

> When a Keyword redirects to a Page, the words `(redirected from [keyword])` are shown in the title.

### Synopsis

The `Synopsis` is a document where the author for a new Term defines the information that will be used to publish the Term to the Glossary, and to create the social video that accompanies it. When you [register to define a new Term](https://aka.ms/define/new), the process will create a new draft Synopsis.

The Synopsis has two main goals:

- Help us understand your project so that we can approve it as fast as possible.

- Help you plan your video so that the recording session and the editing go as easy and smoothly as possible.

You can write the Synopsis by following the process described below in this document.

> You can see [an example of completed Synopsis here](https://aka.ms/glossary/sample/synopsis).

### Commit

When you edit the Synopsis, you will see the term `commit` coming up here and there. This is a technical term used in GitHub (a source control system used to manage the Glossary's files). For example `commit to the cloud` means "save your file to the cloud". This will allow us to see your changes.

## What should you do first?

If you have not done this already, [you should submit the "New term" form](https://aka.ms/define/new).

After you submit this form, you will get an email with a link to the new Synopsis. You can then fill the sections. Follow the instructions below!

### Short Description

The Short Description will be used later in the social videos, in the title card.

> IMPORTANT **Please keep the Short Description between 60 and 200 characters**.

You can see an example here:

## Completing the synopsis

At this point you should have received an email with instructions about the next steps. The email has a link pointing you to a new file that was created in the Microsoft Glossary GitHub repository. This is where you will spend most of your time during this phase of the work. The email reads:
