## Transcript

Hello and welcome to [Microsoft Azure Words of the Day](/), this is the show that teaches you Azure vocabulary!

Today's word of the day is an abbreviation: AAD

AAD is short for Azure Active Directory.

It is a fundamental component of Azure and it has to do with security, more specifically with identity and access management. It's sometimes called IDaaS, or Identity as a service.

AAD has wide applications to identify and authorize people, inside Azure of course but also inside your own organization. It can also be used to manage the identity of your users for third party cloud applications, or even to manage the identity of your customers.

There are different editions of AAD, Free, Basic and Premium. Each edition has specific features, so make sure to check the documentation here.

You can integrate with AAD at multiple levels: In the Microsoft cloud, with Microsoft 365 or any of our Platform as a Service offerings. In Windows 10 to join a device to an organization. It can also handle single sign-on, B2C and B2B, and more.

It's easy to use multi-factor authentication with AAD. For example by using the Microsoft Authenticator app, this is how I can use my fingerprint to confirm that I want to log into a Microsoft domain, for example the Azure Portal. Of course this also works for a wide range of sites and applications.

Azure Active Directory has a lot of great features and it makes setting up identity services much easier than it used to be. So make sure to check all the links that we assembled for you here! Thank you so much for watching Microsoft Azure Words of the Day. Today's word of the day was: AAD.
