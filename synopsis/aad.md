Hello and welcome to Microsoft Azure Words of the Day,
the show that teaches you Azure vocabulary!

AAD is short for Azure Active Directory.

> show phonetics

This is a fundamental component of Azure and has to do with security, or more specifically with identity and access management. It's sometimes called IDaaS, or Identity as a service.

![Schema 1](images/aad/schema1.png)

AAD has wide applications to identify and authorize people, inside Azure of course but also inside your own organization. It can also be used to manage the identity of your users for third party cloud applications, or even to manage the identity of your customers.

![Editions](images/aad/editions.png)

There are different editions of AAD, Free Basic and Premium. Each edition has specific features, so make sure to check the documentation here.

You can integrate with AAD at multiple levels: In the Microsoft cloud, with Microsoft 365 or any of our Platform as a Service offerings. In Windows 10 to join a device to an organization. It can also handle single sign-on, B2C and B2B and more.

> demo: authentication with MS Authenticator into Azure Portal

It's easy to use multi-factor authentication with AAD. For example by using the Microsoft Authenticator app, this is how I can use my fingerprint to confirm that I want to log into a Microsoft domain, for example the Azure Portal. Of course this also works for a wide range of sites and applications.
