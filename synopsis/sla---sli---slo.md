## Short description

SLA stands for service-level agreement, and is a commitment between service provider and client/customer. Particular aspects of the service – quality, availability, responsibilities – are agreed between the service provider and the service user. Not to be confused with SLO (service-level objective), or SLI (Service Level Indicator). SLIs form the basis of SLOs, which in turn form the basis of SLAs. SLAs are described in "number of nines" a vendor can guarantee (3 nines being for instance 99,95% uptime, 5 nines being 99,9995%).
